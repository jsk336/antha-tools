Package cover provides support for parsing coverage profiles generated by "go
test -coverprofile=cover.out".

## Usage

#### func  ParseProfiles

```go
func ParseProfiles(fileName string) ([]*Profile, error)
```
ParseProfiles parses profile data in the specified file and returns a Profile
for each source file described therein.

#### type Boundary

```go
type Boundary struct {
	Offset int     // Location as a byte offset in the source file.
	Start  bool    // Is this the start of a block?
	Count  int     // Event count from the cover profile.
	Norm   float64 // Count normalized to [0..1].
}
```

Boundary represents the position in a source file of the beginning or end of a
block as reported by the coverage profile. In HTML mode, it will correspond to
the opening or closing of a <span> tag and will be used to colorize the source

#### type Profile

```go
type Profile struct {
	FileName string
	Mode     string
	Blocks   []ProfileBlock
}
```

Profile represents the profiling data for a specific file.

#### func (*Profile) Boundaries

```go
func (p *Profile) Boundaries(src []byte) (boundaries []Boundary)
```
Boundaries returns a Profile as a set of Boundary objects within the provided
src.

#### type ProfileBlock

```go
type ProfileBlock struct {
	StartLine, StartCol int
	EndLine, EndCol     int
	NumStmt, Count      int
}
```

ProfileBlock represents a single block of profiling data.
